# Redesign Notes

This redesign focused on a complete visual overhaul of the `App.tsx` demo component, migrating from CSS Modules to Tailwind CSS. The core application logic remains entirely unchanged.

## Key Changes

1. **Layout:**
    - Implemented a responsive 3-column layout for desktop screens (`lg` breakpoint and above) as specified:
      - **Left Column (3/12):** Game Status, PGN Controls, FEN Input, Premove Examples.
      - **Center Column (6/12):** Chess Board and Board Options.
      - **Right Column (3/12):** Evaluation Bar, Move Timeline, and Live Examples.
    - The layout collapses to a single column on smaller screens for mobile-friendliness.

2. **Styling:**
    - Replaced all classes from `App.module.css` with Tailwind CSS utility classes.
    - Implemented the specified dark theme with a gradient background (`#1a1625` to `#2d1b3d`).
    - Styled all panels using a "glassmorphism" effect (`bg-gray-900/70`, `backdrop-blur-lg`, `border-gray-800`).
    - Updated typography, buttons, and inputs to match the modern aesthetic described in the project brief.

3. **Header:**
    - A new fixed header was created, containing the app title, theme/language selectors, and navigation links, with a background blur effect.

4. **File Cleanup:**
    - `App.module.css` was deleted as it is now redundant.
    - A new `demo/styles/global.css` file was created to include the core Tailwind directives.

5. **Setup:**
    - Added `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` as development dependencies.
    - Configured `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.

All functional components, state management, and event handlers were preserved exactly as they were, ensuring zero functional regression.
