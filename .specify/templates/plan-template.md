# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Plans MUST capture how the proposal satisfies each constitutional guardrail:
1. **Scope Fit** (Principle 1 & Purpose): Confirms work belongs in the TypeScript-first, client-side library.
2. **Runtime Minimalism** (Principle 2): Describes dependency impact and opt-in story for heavy features.
3. **API Stability** (Principle 3): States whether public contracts change and the migration narrative.
4. **Chess Correctness** (Principle 4): Lists rules/engine behaviors covered by tests.
5. **Performance & Bundle Discipline** (Principle 5): Quantifies FPS/bundle implications and mitigation.
6. **Quality Gates** (Principle 6): Identifies lint/test/build suites plus new coverage.
7. **Docs & Demos** (Principle 7): Notes required MkDocs/README/demo updates.
8. **UX & Accessibility** (Principle 8): Explains how defaults, accessibility extensions, and polish are preserved.
9. **Spec-Driven Workflow** (Principles 9 & 10): Links to `/speckit.specify` artifacts and reuse of existing abstractions.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
