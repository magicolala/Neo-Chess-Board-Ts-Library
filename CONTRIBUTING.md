### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with demo
- `npm run build` - Build both library and demo
- `npm run build:lib` - Build library only
- `npm run build:demo` - Build demo only
- `npm test` - Run tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

## üß™ Testing

We use Jest for testing. All contributions should include appropriate tests.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the existing test patterns in the codebase
- Ensure good test coverage for new features

Example test structure:

```typescript
describe('YourFeature', () => {
  it('should behave correctly when...', () => {
    // Test implementation
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

## üìù Code Style

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define proper interfaces and types
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### Naming Conventions

- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Use kebab-case for file names

## üé® Themes Development

When working on themes:

- Ensure consistent visual style across pieces
- Test themes with different board orientations
- Verify readability and accessibility
- Follow the existing theme structure

## üêõ Bug Reports
